# Zenodo harvest — final result (Aug 2026)

The first full Zenodo harvest run on CSD3 is **complete**: every one of the 1,352
triage-kept records has been attempted, and the assembled training dataset is the
`extxyz.gz` shards + `metadata.jsonl` under `data/dataset/`.

## Headline (final, post 2026-09-18 sweep)

| quantity | value |
|---|---|
| Discover candidates (all resource types, gates on) | **10,435** |
| Triage keep-list (rank ≥ 3, post-peek) | **1,352** |

shards; fetched 311, fetch-rejected 1,041; calc-unit parse ceiling 176,739 / 195,233 = 90.5%.)*

## Frame-recovery sweep (September 2026) — initial harvest closed

A gap investigation (logs + rejection manifests + code) drove three targeted recoveries that returned
real, in-scope VASP data the first run had missed — **+3,219 calcs / +115,489 frames / +7 records** —
all appended in the same schema (same `parse`/`store`; disjoint calc_ids; `verify` still exact).
Scripts: `scripts/csd3/{48_split_reparse_4272054,49_rar_recover,50_refetch_14773462}.sh`.

| # | recovery | +records | +calcs | +frames | what it was |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | de-concatenate `4272054` | 1 | 27 | 46,907 | `vasprun_re1_re26.xml` was 27 concatenated, individually-truncated AIMD restart segments of one superionic-PbF₂ run; pymatgen read only the first `<modeling>` root (499 frames). Split at `<?xml` boundaries → 27 segment vaspruns → 46,907 frames. (Correlated MD — subsample at training.) |
| 2 | RAR-archive bucket | 6 | 2,980 | 36,968 | 14 records whose `.rar` archives failed extraction in the first run only because no `unrar` binary was on PATH (`RarCannotExec`); a static `unrar` in `~/bin` fixed it. 7 yielded VASP (led by `20404673` metal-insulator, ~2,411 calcs); the other 7 correctly had none — `17522462` = 17.3 GB **CP2K/DP-GEN, not VASP**, two inputs-only, four small processed-data. `13744522` was already partly in-dataset → its 274 committed calcs were skipped (no dupes) and its rar-derived calcs added. |
| 3 | re-fetch `14773462` | 0 (augmented) | 212 | 31,614 | the record whose truncated vasprun once hung the pipeline; its files had been `rm`'d as the stopgap, leaving 221 `FileNotFoundError` calcs. Re-fetched + parsed with `--retry-rejected`; resume skipped the 58 already-stored (no dupes), recovered 212 of 221 (9 genuinely truncated). 58 → 270 calcs. |

Every recovery wrote directly into the dataset via `parse`'s resume (skip-committed → **no duplicates**,
proven live: the RAR job skipped exactly 274 of `13744522`, the re-fetch skipped exactly 58 of
`14773462`) and `--retry-rejected` / a fresh manifest (→ **no missing**), with `verify` OK after each.
The unrecoverable residue is now only genuinely-bad data: truncated/incomplete DFT runs (both vasprun
and OUTCAR cut off), NEB/positionless OUTCARs, non-VASP deposits (CP2K / experimental), and inputs-only
records — none carry an ingestable VASP energy+forces label. **The initial Zenodo harvest is closed.**

### Parser split (final, 11,986,018 frames)
`pymatgen.Vasprun` 8,829,912 · `ase.OUTCAR` 3,063,649 · `pymatgen.Vaspout` 92,457. Convergence
(calc-level, final step): converged 178,824 / unconverged 842 / null 292; 20,451 individual frames
SCF-unconverged (tagged per-frame). Forces on 100% of frames; stress on 4,947,934. Full field parity
(run_type/functional/INCAR/POTCAR/k-points, per-calc availability, `electronic` net moment+charge,
per-frame `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged`) preserved across the sweep.

## Expansion beyond the initial harvest (licence relaxation + mentor record)

The closed harvest above is licence-gated (CC0 / CC-BY / CC-BY-SA + permissive only). Two
mentor-directed expansions add data outside that gate; both use the **identical** fetch→parse→store
path, so every added record carries the same field-level detail (calc_parameters / quality /
availability / electronic / per-frame convergence / REF_*), with the licence kept in provenance.

- **Approach 2 — record 10579527 (DONE 2026-09-18).** Mentor's "ML structural reconstructions for
  accelerated point-defect calculations" — access_right=open but **no licence**, so the gate had
  dropped it. Harvested by-ID (`scripts/csd3/51_fetch_10579527.sh`): **+2,147 calcs / +102,502 frames
  / +1 record** (3 of 2,150 calc-units unparseable — the authors' own "Difficult" / "High_Energy"
  extreme bond-distortion vaspruns: `IndexError`, no OUTCAR to fall back to). `provenance.license` is
  null (faithful; a deliberate no-licence inclusion). **Dataset after Approach 2: 301 records /
  182,105 calcs / 12,088,520 frames** (`verify` OK).
- **Approach 1 — NonCommercial licence expansion (DONE 2026-09-19; LOW YIELD).** Re-discovered with the
  gate off (22,505 scanned → 12,535 candidates), filtered to **NC + NC-SA** (378 candidates: 298
  cc-by-nc-4.0, 62 cc-by-nc-sa-4.0, +tail), triaged → **25 kept**, fetched+parsed **directly into the
  production dataset** (`52_discover_nc.sh` → parameterised `20_pipeline.sh` with `IN=nc_keep
  RAW_DIR=raw_nc`). **Result: +2 records / +6 calcs / +202 frames** (both `cc-by-nc-4.0`: `10821289`,
  `7643292`). Of the 25 kept, only 6 were genuinely VASP (peek-confirmed); 2 yielded, 4 hit
  `no_calc_units_after_extract` (likely false-positive filename matches). The other 19 were
  non-materials false positives (music / weather / AI / cryo-EM / ORCA) kept fail-safe (unpeekable
  archives) that fetch rejected. **Finding: the NC-licensed subset of Zenodo matching these queries is
  overwhelmingly non-materials — the open CC-BY set had already captured essentially all the materials
  VASP data, so licence relaxation adds little.**

> **Current dataset (2026-10-02): ~620 records / 383,849 calcs / 18,213,119 frames**, `verify` exact —
> the Zenodo census (keyword-invisible VASP deposits, FURTHER_WORK part A, complete) added, on top of
> the state below, T1 230 records / 173,289 calcs / 5,669,216 frames and T2 87 records / 28,449 calcs /

> +111%, frames +51%); see `docs/ZENODO_CENSUS.md` §11. The sections below describe the keyword harvest as it was closed on
> 2026-09-19.

### Dataset after both expansions (2026-09-19)
**~303 records / 182,111 calcs / 12,088,722 frames**, `verify` exact (bijection 0 missing/dup/orphan).
Parser split: pymatgen.Vasprun 8,932,614 / ase.OUTCAR 3,063,651 / pymatgen.Vaspout 92,457 frames.
Licence spread (frames): cc-by-4.0 11.73M, cc-zero 128k, null 102,502 (record 10579527), cc-by-sa-4.0
63k, other-open 57k, mit 5.5k, cc-by-nc-4.0 202, + permissive tail.

## First harvest stage — COMPLETE (2026-09-19)

The Zenodo harvest (initial run + recovery sweep + the two expansions) is **marked done**. Final
dataset: **~303 records / 182,111 calcs / 12,088,722 frames**, `verify` exact. What follows documents
the method's limitations and the complementary work that could extend it later — none of which is an
easy, high-gain fix, which is why the stage is closed here.

### Limitations of the current approach (be aware when using / extending the dataset)

- *(2026-09-25: addressed by the Zenodo census — `docs/ZENODO_CENSUS.md`, which also measured two
  more search-side causes: `&nbsp;`-glued words and unstemmed quoted phrases.)*
- **Metadata-only discovery — the main recall gap.** Zenodo's search (`q`) indexes metadata *text*
  (title/description/keywords/creators) **and top-level filenames**, but **nothing inside archives**.
  Since nearly all VASP data is packed in `.zip`/`.tar.gz`, a record is found only if its description
  or keywords carry a DFT/VASP signal. Records with rich data but bare metadata are **invisible** —
  proven live: Sean Kavanagh's `13888307` (19.6 GB of VASP) has `keywords: null` and a description of
  just *"Accompanying data … article link"*, so no keyword query matched it. A creator/ORCID census of
  his uploads found **15 of 30 missing**, ~4 of them real VASP defect datasets, lost to this gap (+ the
  licence gate). This is systematic and dataset-wide, affecting an unknown number of other records.
- **Filename search does not help.** Only ~8 records Zenodo-wide expose a bare top-level
  `vasprun.xml`/`OUTCAR` (measured); the rest are archived, and Zenodo cannot see inside archives — so a
  dedicated filename search adds ≈0 beyond what the keyword queries already catch.
- **Licence gate (intentional).** Keeps CC0 / CC-BY / CC-BY-SA + permissive; drops NonCommercial (NC),
  NoDerivatives (ND), and no-licence records — to keep the assembled set redistributable. The NC
  expansion confirmed this costs little real materials data (mostly non-materials). Specific no-licence
  records can still be added by ID with permission (e.g. `10579527`).
- **Access gate.** Embargoed/restricted/closed records are dropped (they 403 at fetch regardless).
- **VASP-only scope (intentional).** Only VASP outputs (`vasprun.xml`/`vaspout.h5`/`OUTCAR`) are parsed.
  Other DFT/QC codes are **not** ingested — e.g. CP2K/DP-GEN (`17522462`), ORCA, and by extension
  Quantum ESPRESSO, CASTEP, FHI-aims, GPAW, etc. Processed/ML-relaxed data (ASE `.db`, extxyz, `.npy`,
  MACE-relaxed supercells such as `15830542`) is not ingested — only raw VASP.
- **Archive/parse edges.** Multipart/split archives (`.z01`) aren't reassembled; encrypted archives are
  skipped; `.rar` needs an `unrar` binary (now installed). Truncated/incomplete vaspruns/OUTCARs, NEB/
  positionless OUTCARs (tangent-projected forces), and RPA/GW energyless steps are unrecoverable/dropped
  by design. Concatenated multi-root vaspruns need a manual split (done for `4272054`; no general
  detector was run).
- **Storage scope.** Heavy files (CHGCAR/WAVECAR/DOSCAR/…) are recorded as *availability* only, not stored.
- **Point-in-time freshness.** Discovery is a dated `created`-window scan; records published after a run
  need a re-discover. Dedup is by `conceptrecid` (newest version wins).

### Potential further work (roughly best-first)

- **Literature-graph discovery** — OpenAlex/Crossref/Semantic Scholar → DFT/VASP papers → their
  data-availability Zenodo DOIs. Uses the paper's rich metadata to bypass sparse Zenodo metadata (would
  have caught `13888307`). The most promising systemic complement; partial recall; free APIs.
- **Bounded archive-peek pass** over a paper-linked / materials-journal-linked net (the only way to see
  inside archives, made feasible by narrowing the net under the 30 req/min cap).
- **Cross-platform sources** — Materials Cloud Archive, OPTIMADE, MPContribs (curated materials data,
  no metadata blind spot).
- **Multi-code parsing** — add Quantum ESPRESSO / CP2K / CASTEP / FHI-aims readers to widen beyond VASP.
- **Author/ORCID- or community-seeded discovery** — effective but manual (last resort).
- **Systematic completeness comes from elsewhere** — NOMAD (done, 7.1 M) + Materials Project (mp-api,
  planned) are the structured corpora without this blind spot; Zenodo is deliberately the long tail (many small deposits from
  individual groups).

## Yield vs. the pre-run estimate

Survey #4 projected **≈416** records with a parseable VASP primary (band ~255–571). The
actual **≈293** sits just below the pessimistic end. The deviation is fully accounted for
and is **not** a systemic miss (verified with `scripts/estimate/yield_by_bucket.py`):

- The high-confidence buckets landed on target — directly-exposed + peek-confirmed-primary
  records (~197) yielded ~98%.
- The shortfall is entirely in the two buckets the survey flagged as least certain:
  - **evidence-gap zips** (nested/ZIP64): survey *assumed* ~20% yield; the fetch pass
    measured **~2.3%** — the assumption was ~10× optimistic (nested content is mostly
    foreign/compressed, not VASP).
  - **non-zip archives** (tar/rar/7z): ~15% vs the survey's ~21% (within its n=28 CI).

Discovery (10,435 ≈ survey's 10,373) and triage (1,352 ≈ 2,800 relevant − ~1,464 peek-dropped
no-VASP zips) both matched the survey model exactly, so the gap is purely fetch-yield of the
speculative tail.

## Parse ceiling (the 90.5%)

The ~9.5% of fetched calc units not in the dataset were **parse-attempted and terminally
rejected**, not uncollected:

| reason | count | note |
|---|---|---|
| `outcar_parse_error` | 17,037 | dominant — OUTCAR-only **NEB / positionless OUTCARs** ASE can't extract positions from (incl. the manually-excluded `14773462`) |
| `vasprun_parse_error` | 665 | corrupt vaspruns |
| `no_frames` | 779 | calcs with no recoverable energy |
| `primary_too_large` | 88 | **recoverable** — skipped for RAM; a higher-RAM re-parse (`--max-primary-bytes`) would collect them |
| `extract_error` | 1,715 | archive members that failed to extract (incl. now-fixed encrypted-7z / corrupt-xz) |

The only cheap recovery is the ~88 `primary_too_large` (bigger-RAM re-parse). The NEB bulk
would need a NEB-aware parser (see "Known gaps").

## Dataset composition — frames ≫ diversity

The dataset is **heavily dominated by a few frame-rich AIMD/MC deposits**:

- `5720009` alone = **5,559,902 frames (47%)**; top-2 records ≈ 61%.
- ~293 records / ~177k calc units produce ~11.9M frames — trajectory-dense but with far
  fewer *independent* configurations than the frame count suggests.

**For training:** report and weight by diversity (distinct compositions, `potcar_set_hash`,
`run_type`, source `resource_type`/`license`) and expect to subsample correlated trajectory
frames — 11.9M frames from ~293 deposits is *deep but narrow*.

## Un-harvested / excluded records

All 1,352 keep-list records were attempted; the un-harvested handful are genuine, documented
limits, not lost science:

- **`18012696` — permanently excluded** (`manually_excluded`). Its archive unpacks to
  **millions of tiny files**, exceeding the CSD3 `/rds` **1M-inode** filesystem limit — it
  cannot be staged on this filesystem at all.
- **`14773462`** — manually excluded earlier (source of the 221 `FileNotFoundError`s).
- **`8005679`** — a nested Monte-Carlo tarball (`MC_rocksalt_data.tar.gz` → per-generation
  `vasp_store.tar.gz`s, ~300k extracted files); it **was** fetched and parsed (**+37,054
  frames**), just slowly.

**Known recoverable gaps** (optional future work): the ~88 `primary_too_large` calcs
(higher-RAM re-parse) and the NEB `outcar_parse_error` calcs (a NEB-aware OUTCAR parser —
their positions/forces are in the per-image OUTCARs, but ASE's `vasp-out` reader can't
reconstruct the band; verify the reported forces are true DFT forces, not tangent-projected,
before ingesting).

## Dataset format & provenance

- **Storage:** rotating `shard-NNNNN.extxyz.gz` + one `metadata.jsonl` record per calc,
  joined by `calc_id` / `frame_id`.
- **Labels (MACE keys, in `atoms.info`/`atoms.arrays`):** per-ionic-step `REF_energy`
  (E0, σ→0), `REF_forces`, `REF_stress` (ASE Voigt convention, eV/Å³), plus `E_free`
  (+`entropy_TS`) for the force/stress-consistent free energy, and the per-structure
  `total_magnetization` (net moment) + `total_charge` on every frame (`electronic.py`).
  *(Superseded 2026-08-17: the earlier per-atom `dft_charge`/`dft_magmom` on the final frame are
  replaced by the totals; run the `net_properties_recover` campaign — CSD3 script 47 — to retrofit
  the existing dataset.)*
- **Per-frame quality:** `electronic_converged` + `scf_dE` (that step's own SCF verdict),
  and calc-level `quality` (frame counts, `max_abs_free_minus_e0_per_atom`).
  *(Superseded 2026-08-18: `electronic_converged`/`scf_dE` are now filled on the **OUTCAR** path
  too — read from the OUTCAR SCF trace, free-energy basis, `scf_dE_key="free_energy"`; the original
  OUTCAR-parsed calcs left them `null`. Calc-level `ionic_converged` also reaches OUTCAR parity
  (was `null`; reimplemented from NSW/IBRION/EDIFFG). The ionic-convergence *magnitude* (last-two-
  frames ΔE) is intentionally NOT stored — not a per-frame training-label signal. The SAME script-47
  campaign retrofits all of this alongside the net moment/charge — see `zenodo_harvest/convergence.py`.)*
- **Provenance/filtering:** source DOI, `resource_type`, `license`, full INCAR/k-points/
  POTCAR, and `potcar_set_hash` (pseudopotential-set fingerprint — absolute energies are
  only comparable within an identical POTCAR set + functional + settings).

## Current dataset state (post recoveries, 2026-08-21)

Measured from `metadata.jsonl` (net charge/spin are per-calc constants broadcast to every frame,
so frame-weighted = Σ n_frames of qualifying calcs; cross-checked against a direct shard scan).
Parser split — calcs / frames: `ase.OUTCAR` 93,043 / 3,041,256 · `pymatgen.Vasprun` 83,351 /
8,736,816 · `pymatgen.Vaspout` 345 / 92,457.

**Net charge** (`Z_neutral − NELECT`) and **net spin** (`total_magnetization`, μ_B = N↑−N↓):

| | frame-weighted | calc-weighted |
|---|---|---|
| net charge — non-zero / zero / null | 14.43% / 84.99% / **0.58%** | 13.85% / 85.98% / 0.17% |
| net spin — `\|m\|>0.5` / `>1e-6` / zero / null | 6.03% / 6.96% / 92.97% / **0.07%** | 31.6% non-zero / 0.69% null |

Coverage: net charge **99.42% frames / 99.83% calcs**; net spin **99.93% frames / 99.31% calcs**.
Note the **frame-vs-calc skew**: ~31.6% of *calcs* are magnetic but only ~6% of *frames* — magnetic
calcs have short trajectories, so frame count is dominated by non-magnetic relaxations/AIMD; balance a
training set at the frame level accordingly.

**Convergence** (calc-level `quality`, the *final* ionic step — this is what `verify` reports as
`calcs_by_electronic_converged`; the *per-frame* verdict + `scf_dE` live on every frame in the shards):
`electronic_converged` True 175,606 / False 841 / null 292; `total_n_frames_scf_unconverged` 20,393.
`ionic_converged` **100% covered** (True 166,377 / False 10,362).

### Why some spin/charge are still "unavailable" (and how much)

| field | reason | calcs | frames |
|---|---|---|---|
| **net spin** | non-collinear **without an OUTCAR** — net moment needs the heavy projected magnetization, so recorded unavailable (all single-point → 1 frame each) | 1,117 | 1,117 (0.009%) |
| **net spin** | ISPIN=2 vasprun/vaspout **without an OUTCAR** whose eigenvalues pymatgen couldn't parse (occupancy-method fallback failed) | 106 | 7,287 (0.061%) |
| **net charge** | **vaspout.h5 without a co-located OUTCAR** — the HDF5 exposes no `<atominfo>` valence column and no resolvable NELECT/POTCAR-titel, so neither NELECT nor ZVAL is available | 282 | 68,886 (0.580%) |
| **net charge** | vasprun/OUTCAR where NELECT or ZVAL was unresolvable (missing tag, or titel↔ions-per-type mismatch → refused rather than guessed) | 13 | 22 (0.000%) |

So the only non-trivial gap is vaspout-without-OUTCAR charge (0.58% of frames). The vaspout calcs that
*did* have a co-located OUTCAR (63, all in record `16448106`) were recovered via the OUTCAR fallback
(`electronic_from_object`); the same clean re-fetch also corrected 24 of that record's vaspout net-spin
values from "unavailable" to 0.0 — see below. Closing the remaining 282 would need a vaspout-HDF5
`/input`,`/results` probe for NELECT/ZVAL.

### Why the vaspout calcs had "unavailable" net spin before the `16448106` re-run

Record `16448106` was a transient-failure straggler (HTTP 504s) in the first recovery, so its
`vaspout.h5` files were staged incompletely — the compute step could not read `ISPIN` from the
partial HDF5 and recorded the net spin (and charge) as "unavailable". The clean re-fetch produced
intact files; since all 87 of the record's vaspout calcs are **ISPIN=1** (non-collinear=0), the net
spin is correctly **0.0**, and 24 previously-"unavailable" values were fixed (an improvement, not a
regression — verified against ISPIN). The 63 with a co-located OUTCAR additionally gained net charge.

## Operational lessons (for the mentor & the NOMAD phase)

- **Lustre small-file pathology is the binding constraint**, not bytes or CPU. Many-file
  archives explode the **inode** count; extraction, `purge-raw`, cleanup walks, and `verify`
  all bottleneck (or hang in uninterruptible `D` state) on Lustre metadata ops. Several jobs
  timed out / OOM'd on this, and a degraded OST (transient `lfs quota` `[…]` warnings) made
  it worse.
- **`files_total` in the manifest counts the Zenodo record's files** (an archive = 1) — it
  says nothing about extracted contents. A "1-file" 10 GB `.tar.gz` can unpack to hundreds of
  thousands of files. Gauge giants by live extraction rate / `tar -tzf | wc -l`, not
  `files_total`.
- **`scripts/csd3/20_pipeline.sh` always runs the full `keep.jsonl` and self-resubmits
  (`RESUBMIT=1`)** — after any `scancel`, re-check `squeue` for a chain successor before
  cleanup/finish, and use `43_finish.sh` (explicit `--in`, no resubmit) to target one record.
- **Tooling added this run:** `scripts/estimate/{yield_by_bucket,attempt_count,inspect_unconfirmed_zips,parse_error_breakdown,staging_report,harvest_audit,cleanup_staging}.py`
  and `scripts/csd3/{40_cleanup,41_parse,42_verify,43_finish}.sh`. `status` gained a
  record-level `RECORDS` line.
- **Bug fixes this run:** extractor error handling now catches `lzma.LZMAError` (corrupt xz)
  and `py7zr.exceptions.PasswordRequired` (encrypted 7z) — previously these crashed the
  fetch worker and re-attempted forever; a post-extract prune drops files no calc unit
  references (KPOINTS/OSZICAR/stray) at fetch time; and `verify` now reads frame metadata by
  text-parsing (no per-frame `Atoms`), so it scales to 10M+ frames.

## Next step

Zenodo is the long tail of DFT data; the large reusable corpora live elsewhere. The natural
next source is **NOMAD** (see `docs/NOMAD_HARVEST.md`), which offers far more scale and
diversity; deduplication against this Zenodo set is the main risk to plan for.

**Update (2026-09-07): the NOMAD harvest is now COMPLETE** — 7,073,592 calcs / 52,459,065 frames,
`verify` exact (see `docs/NOMAD_HARVEST_RESULT.md`). The two datasets are still separate
(`.../zenodo/dataset` and `.../nomad/dataset`); fold them with `merge-datasets` when training
wants a single corpus (mind the merge's metadata-materialisation RAM at NOMAD scale).
