# Data harvest & storage design

This note answers the design questions for the Zenodo → VASP → MLIP-dataset
pipeline, grounded in the Zenodo REST API behaviour observed on 2026-07-09.

## Implementation status (2026-07-13)

All five stages run end-to-end (`zenodo_harvest` package). Decisions locked in
after the first fetch+parse build, validated on Zenodo record 17930461 (63
vasprun.xml → 4047 frames) + 17378016 (OUTCAR-only → 40 frames):

- **Metadata store = JSONL** (`data/dataset/metadata.jsonl`), one record per
  calculation: provenance (source/DOI/citation/license/url), full calc
  parameters (run_type, INCAR, k-points, POTCAR spec, ENCUT/EDIFF/…), quality
  (`electronic_converged` + `scf_dE` magnitude, ionic convergence, counts), and
  availability flags. Compact to Parquet later if/when query speed needs it.
- **Energy** stored per frame = `e_0_energy` (σ→0), with pymatgen's `final_energy`
  bugfix applied to *every* ionic step. **Forces** per frame. Both written under
  MACE's default **`REF_energy`/`REF_forces`** keys, straight into `atoms.info`/
  `atoms.arrays` (a `SinglePointCalculator` would emit the reserved `energy`/`forces`
  keys, which ASE re-absorbs into a calculator on read-back — removing them from
  `info`/`arrays`; the `REF_` keys survive and stay queryable).
- **Stress IS a training label** (mentor decision 2026-07-20) — stored under MACE's
  `REF_stress` key in **ASE's convention**: a Voigt-6 vector `[xx,yy,zz,yz,xz,xy]` in
  eV/Å³ with ASE's sign. The vasprun/vaspout path converts VASP's raw kBar 3×3 tensor
  (`× −0.1 × ase.units.GPa` + Voigt reorder — exactly ASE's own vasprun.xml reader);
  the OUTCAR path takes ASE's `vasp-out` stress, already in this convention. Both paths
  emit an identical `REF_stress`.
- **Net magnetic moment + net charge** are stored per calc (see `zenodo_harvest/electronic.py`)
  and broadcast onto *every* frame as `total_magnetization` (μ_B, = N_up−N_down = 2·S) and
  `total_charge` (e, = Z_neutral−NELECT; + = electron-deficient), plus mirrored into the metadata
  `electronic` block. Net moment: from the OUTCAR magnetization line when present; else, for a
  collinear spin-polarised vasprun/vaspout without an OUTCAR, the eigenvalue-occupancy method
  (`N_up−N_down`, doped's approach, needs `parse_eigen`); 0 for ISPIN=1; null for non-collinear
  without an OUTCAR. Net charge: `NELECT` from parameters and Z_neutral from the vasprun
  `<atominfo>` valence / OUTCAR header ZVAL / the bundled POTCAR-stats table. **Per-atom**
  charges/spins are NOT stored (only the totals).
- **POTCAR** files are not parsed (copyright + often absent): we keep the `titel`
  strings; `hash` is null.
- Parser precedence: `pymatgen.Vasprun` (primary) → ASE `vasp-out` (OUTCAR-only
  fallback, read from an isolated temp copy to dodge ASE's neighbour-file crash).

## TL;DR recommendations

| Question | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Storage format for atomistic data | **extxyz.gz**, one frame per ionic step, sharded (≈10k frames/shard) |
| Where metadata / calc params live | **separate columnar metadata store** (JSONL while harvesting → Parquet), keyed by a stable `frame_id`; *not* stuffed into every extxyz header |
| How to find only materials-DFT data | **two-stage funnel**: permissive metadata search (recall) → parse-time validation (precision) |
| Filter by `.extxyz` file extension? | **No** — misses ~all raw VASP (it's inside archives) and inherits the uploader's processing. Use it only as a bonus "already-processed" source. |
| Maximise size / exhaust Zenodo | broad keyword set + **recursive date-partitioning** past the 10k window + relevant **communities**; OAI-PMH for a true full sweep |
| Quality assurance | reject at parse time, not search time; **log every rejection with a reason** so recall is auditable; tag electronic convergence + its magnitude |

## 1. Zenodo API facts that drive the design

Verified against `https://zenodo.org/api/records`:

- **`q` searches metadata text only** (title/description/keywords), *not* file
  contents. `q=vasprun` → **0** hits; `q=VASP` → 314; `q=OUTCAR` → 37. You cannot
  find a `vasprun.xml` by searching for it.
- **The DFT outputs live inside archives.** The `file_type` aggregation for
  `q=VASP` is dominated by `zip`, `gz`, `tar`, `tgz`, `rar` — only *2* records
  expose a raw `.xml`. So **file-extension filtering finds almost nothing.**
- **The search response already lists each record's files** (`files[].key`,
  `size`, `checksum`, download link). Triage on filenames is therefore free.
- **Rate limit**: ~30 req/min anonymous (`Retry-After` on 429). A personal
  access token (`ZENODO_TOKEN`) raises it — needed for a full harvest.
- **Page size caps at 25**; `size>=50` → HTTP 400.
- **Search window caps at 10,000** (`page*size <= 10000`). Bigger result sets
  must be partitioned (we bisect the `created` date range).
- **Range requests work** on file downloads (206) even though Zenodo omits the
  `Accept-Ranges` header — this is what lets us peek inside a remote `.zip` (triage)
  **and pull individual VASP members straight out of one over HTTP Range** without
  downloading the whole archive (fetch's targeted ZIP fetch, `zipstream.py` — see §3a).

## 2. The extraction funnel (precision vs recall)

Precision ("everything collected is what I want") and recall ("I collect as much
of what I want as possible") pull in opposite directions. Resolve them by
splitting the work: **be permissive early, strict late.**

```
                         cheap, no download        expensive, but authoritative
 keyword search  ─────►  file-listing triage  ─►  download  ─►  pymatgen parse  ─►  accept/reject
 (high recall)           (+ optional zip-peek)                  (high precision)     (+ reason log)
   ~10^4–10^5 recs         ~10^3–10^4 recs          GBs           final dataset
```

- **Stage 0 discover** (`discover.py`): cast a wide net with many metadata
  keywords. False positives are fine here — they're cheap to carry. Records whose
  `access_right` is present and not `open` are dropped (they 403 at fetch anyway).
  A **license gate** (mentor decision 2026-07-20, default on; `--no-license-gate`
  to disable) drops records whose license forbids redistribution/derivatives —
  Creative-Commons NonCommercial (NC) / NoDerivatives (ND) and records with no
  explicit license (Zenodo `notspecified`/absent = all rights reserved) — keeping
  only openly-reusable data (CC0/CC-BY/CC-BY-SA, `other-open`, permissive software
  licences). The license id is still recorded for attribution (CC-BY/CC-BY-SA).
  Measured cost of the gate is small: ~8% of VASP-relevant records and only ~2-3%
  of the *useful* (rank ≥ 3) ones, almost all CC-NonCommercial. An accepted hit is streamed to an append-only
  sidecar checkpoint (`<out>.hits.jsonl`) as it is seen, with per-window/per-query
  completion sentinels, so a crashed `--exhaustive` run resumes without redoing
  completed API paging (`--fresh` forces a clean rebuild).
- **Stage 1 triage** (`triage.py`): classify each record from its file listing
  into `vasp_direct` / `archive` / `processed_atomistic` / `unlikely`. For
  `archive` records where the payload is hidden, **peek the zip central
  directory over HTTP Range** to confirm `vasprun.xml`/`OUTCAR` *without
  downloading gigabytes* (works for `.zip`; `.tar.gz`/`.rar` need download).
- **Stage 2 fetch** (`fetch.py`): download the VASP-relevant files and lay them out
  one dir per calc. For a `.zip` this is done by **targeted member fetch** by default
  (`zipstream.py`): the same central directory that triage peeks also gives every
  member's byte offset, so the VASP files are pulled straight out over HTTP Range
  (~1 request/file, CRC-verified) **without downloading the whole archive** — skipping
  the heavy CHGCAR/WAVECAR bulk instead of downloading it to extract a few files and
  delete the rest. Falls back to a whole-archive download for anything not addressable
  this way (ZIP64/encrypted target member, too many members, non-zip formats, or a zip
  that contains a **nested archive**). This is the third survey investigation's
  recommendation #2 (tar has no tail index and compressed tars are non-seekable, so only
  ZIP supports it). **Nested archives** (an archive inside an archive) are unpacked
  recursively *after download* for every archive type (`_recurse_nested_archives`), so
  VASP files inside sub-archives are reached — closing the earlier nested-archive gap.
- **Stage 3 parse**: the real precision gate. If pymatgen parses it as a valid
  `Vasprun` with the required properties, keep it; otherwise reject **and log the
  reason**. This is also where consistency (functional, etc.) is recorded.

**Why not just filter by `.extxyz(.gz)`?** Three reasons:
1. **Recall**: raw VASP data is almost never uploaded as extxyz — it's in
   archives of `vasprun.xml`/`OUTCAR`. Filtering by extension would discard the
   bulk of the harvestable data.
2. **Precision/provenance**: an uploaded extxyz has already been through someone
   else's (unknown) processing — you lose control over which ionic steps were
   kept, whether unconverged frames were dropped, unit conventions, and which
   property is in which column. Parsing the VASP source yourself gives uniform,
   trustworthy provenance and convergence tags.
3. **extxyz ≠ VASP**: extxyz files on Zenodo come from many codes (QE, CP2K,
   GPAW, LAMMPS-ML…) with inconsistent property keys — not what we want while
   scoped to VASP.
   → Treat existing `.extxyz`/`.xyz` as a *bonus* `processed_atomistic` bucket to
   revisit later, not the primary filter.

## 3. Storage format & structure

### 3a. Atomistic data → sharded `extxyz.gz`

extxyz is the right default (mentor's call, and it is the de-facto MLIP training
format; round-trips through ASE and pymatgen). **One frame = one ionic step.** A
relaxation with 40 ionic steps becomes 40 frames — minus any step whose corrected
σ→0 energy is unrecoverable (e.g. GW/response steps), which is **dropped** (an
energyless frame is dead weight that can break MACE loaders). Energy-only steps (no
forces) are kept. Kept frames keep their **original ionic-step index** in
`frame_id`/`ionic_step` (never renumbered), and the counts land in `quality`
(`n_frames`, `n_frames_with_forces`, `n_frames_dropped_no_energy`).

Per-frame layout (ASE `Atoms`, written with `ase.io.write(..., format="extxyz")`):

| Quantity | extxyz location | key |
|---|---|---|
| positions | per-atom | (columns) |
| chemical symbols | per-atom | `species` |
| cell + PBC | frame header | `Lattice`, `pbc` |
| forces | per-atom array | `REF_forces` (MACE default) |
| net magnetic moment | frame info | `total_magnetization` (μ_B, = N_up−N_down; per-calc, every frame) |
| net charge | frame info | `total_charge` (e, = Z_neutral−NELECT; per-calc, every frame) |
| total energy | frame info | `REF_energy` (MACE default; σ→0 E0) |
| stress (if present) | frame info | `REF_stress` (eV/Å³, ASE Voigt; training label) |
| free energy F (force-consistent) | frame info | `E_free`; vasprun also `entropy_TS` (=E−F) |
| convergence flags | frame info | `electronic_converged`, `scf_dE` (this frame's OWN ionic step) |
| **link to metadata** | frame info | `frame_id`, `calc_id`, `ionic_step`, `source` |

(Per-atom `dft_charge`/`dft_magmom` are **not** stored — only the per-structure `total_charge` /
`total_magnetization` above. Net charge is frame-invariant; net moment is the calc's converged value.)

Keep the extxyz header **small**: only physical data + a `frame_id` foreign key.
Do **not** repeat the full calculation parameters / provenance in every frame —
that is bulky, and identical across all frames of a run.

**Sharding**: write ~10⁴ frames per `*.extxyz.gz` shard (e.g.
`data/dataset/shard-00042.extxyz.gz`). This keeps files a manageable size for
parallel writes on the cluster, lets jobs append independently, and lets training
stream shards. gzip typically gives ~3–5× on extxyz.

*Availability-only* signals (mentor: record but don't store) — charge density,
spin density, electronic eigenvalues, magnetization, DOS — become **boolean
columns in the metadata store**, plus the source file name, so the heavy data can
be re-fetched later if wanted.

### 3b. Metadata & provenance → columnar store (JSONL → Parquet)

Everything non-atomistic lives in a **separate table keyed by `frame_id`** (and a
coarser `calc_id` for things constant within a run). During harvest, append
JSONL (crash-safe, resumable, parallel-friendly); periodically compact to
**Parquet** for fast column queries and small size. This "big pile of extxyz
shards + a metadata sidecar table + a manifest" pattern is the standard way large
MLIP datasets (OC20/OC22, Materials Project trajectories, Alexandria, MPtrj) are
organised — the atomistic bytes stream from flat files, the queryable metadata
sits in a database/columnar table.

```

**Convergence** (mentor's emphasis): store both the boolean and the *magnitude*.
This is tagged **per frame** on **every parser path** — each frame's
`electronic_converged`/`scf_dE` carry *that step's own* verdict and ΔE
(`|E[-1]-E[-2]|` of its last two SCF steps; `converged` mirrors pymatgen's
`len(electronic_steps) < NELM`). The vasprun path uses pymatgen's per-electronic-step
σ→0 energies; the **OUTCAR path** scans the OUTCAR SCF trace itself
(`convergence.py`: the `Iteration X(Y)` markers + `total energy-change (2. order)`
lines) — `scf_dE` there is the free-energy ΔF (the OUTCAR prints σ→0 only per ionic
step, not per SCF step; the two differ only by the near-converged inter-step entropy
change, and ΔF is VASP's own EDIFF metric), recorded as `scf_dE_key="free_energy"`. A
`vaspout` calc, whose HDF5 output carries no per-SCF data, is filled from a co-located
OUTCAR — **`null` only when a vaspout has no OUTCAR beside it**. Calc-level `quality`
keeps the FINAL-step verdict under the same keys plus `n_frames_scf_unconverged`.
Unconverged frames are kept but **tagged**, never silently mixed in. **Calc-level
`ionic_converged`** (a genuinely calc-level property — did the geometry relaxation
finish) is tracked on all paths: vasprun/vaspout from pymatgen's `converged_ionic`,
and the OUTCAR path now reaches parity by reimplementing that rule from
NSW/IBRION/EDIFFG + the ionic-step count (`convergence.converged_ionic_from_params`).
Its *magnitude* — the last-two-ionic-frames ΔE — is **deliberately not stored**: unlike
the per-frame electronic `scf_dE` it is not a label-quality signal for MLIP training
(off-equilibrium frames are valid, desirable data), and it is derivable from the
per-frame `REF_energy`/`REF_forces` already on every frame.

### 3c. The manifest ties it together

`data/manifests/*.jsonl` records what was discovered/triaged/downloaded/parsed,
so any stage is resumable and the whole harvest is auditable. `calc_id` /
`frame_id` are the join keys between extxyz shards and the metadata table. Paths
inside `fetched.jsonl` are stored **relative to the fetch `raw_dir`**, so staged
data can move between cluster scratch areas without breaking the manifest; parse
resolves them against `--raw-dir` (legacy absolute paths still pass through).

## 4. Maximising coverage (exhausting Zenodo)

1. **Broad keyword set** (OR-combined): VASP, DFT, first-principles, ab-initio,
   vasprun, OUTCAR, plus method/tooling terms (MACE, NequIP, GAP, "interatomic
   potential", "training data") — see `discover.DEFAULT_QUERIES`.
2. **Recursive date-partitioning** (`client.iter_records`): any query > 10k hits
   is bisected on `created` date until each window is ≤ 10k, then fully paged.
   This is the only way past the 10k window and is the cluster full-harvest path.
3. **Communities**: harvest relevant Zenodo communities directly
   (e.g. Materials Cloud mirrors, MLIP-dataset communities) via the
   `communities` filter — often higher precision than free-text.
4. **De-duplicate by `conceptrecid`** (keep newest version) so re-uploads don't
   inflate counts.
5. **OAI-PMH** (`/oai2d`) for a genuine exhaustive sweep of all datasets, if the
   keyword approach proves to miss things — heavier, do on the cluster.
6. **Beyond Zenodo**: the same funnel applies to Materials Cloud, Materials
   Project (`mp-api`), NOMAD — plug in additional `discover` backends later.

## 5. Ensuring quality (both directions)

- **Precision (no junk)**: authoritative check is *"does pymatgen parse it and
  does it carry the required properties?"* Filenames only *route* work; they
  never decide inclusion.
- **Recall (miss little)**: every rejected candidate is written to a
  `rejections.jsonl` with a machine-readable reason (`no_vasp_files`,
  `parse_error`, `no_forces`, `license_excluded`, …). Periodically sample
  rejections by hand to catch systematic misses (e.g. a filename pattern the
  classifier didn't know) and widen the rules.
- **Consistency**: record `functional`/`run_type`/`hubbard_u`/`vdw`/`encut`/
  k-point density so the training set can later be filtered to a coherent subset
  — `run_type` alone is too coarse to guarantee this, so keep the raw INCAR too.
- **Integrity**: verify Zenodo `md5` checksums on download; store them.
- **Dedup at the physics level** (later): identical structures/energies across
  records (common when papers repackage MP data) should be detected via a
  structure+energy hash to avoid double-counting in training.

## 6. Scaling to CSD3

- Stages are independent CLI steps over JSONL manifests → trivially resumable and
  parallelisable (split the manifest, run N array-job tasks, each writing its own
  shards). This is now wired end-to-end: `split` round-robins the fetched manifest
  into `<stem>.part-NNN.jsonl`; each array task runs `parse` into its OWN
  `--dataset-dir` (parse holds a `.parse.lock` so two tasks can never share one dir
  — cross-node locks fail safe, never assumed stale); `merge-datasets` then folds the
  per-task dirs into one by renaming+renumbering shards (opaque gzip blobs are never
  recompressed) and rewriting each metadata record's `shards` list, moving shards
  before appending metadata so a crash leaves only prunable orphans; `verify` asserts
  the metadata↔shard `frame_id` bijection and reports coverage stats (frames by
  parser/run_type/functional/license, per-element counts) as the curation instrument;
  and `purge-raw` deletes each `<raw-dir>/<recid>/` tree whose every calc_id has
  landed in the dataset, reclaiming scratch (units still awaiting a parse re-try are
  kept).
- The `pipeline` command collapses stages 2–4 into one overlapped, disk-paced run:
  `fetch` for batch *i+1* overlaps `parse`+`purge-raw` for batch *i*, with `--workers`
  concurrent downloads inside each fetch. A batch stopped by the disk valve is resumed
  after the background parse+purge reclaims staging, never skipped. This is the
  recommended shape for a single long CSD3 job; the `split`/array/`merge` flow remains
  the way to throw many cores at parsing an already-fetched manifest.
- Keep one `requests.Session`, honour `Retry-After`, use a token; harvest is
  I/O-bound so a modest array (or async) saturates the rate limit safely.
- Parsing is CPU-bound and embarrassingly parallel (one task per archive).
- **Cluster limits shape the design** (CSD3, verified 2026-07-27): a 36 h (SL3: 12 h)
  wallclock means the harvest spans several jobs → every stage resumes, and downloads
  resume mid-file over HTTP Range. Scratch is 1 TB *and 1 million files*, and both bind:
  measured extracted VASP trees run ~7.6 KiB median per file, so 1M inodes can be reached
  near 0.3 TB. `/rds` is Lustre, so that quota counts **inodes** — directories included,
  which is why the harvest charges for every directory it creates, not only for files.
  Batch templates: `scripts/csd3/`.
- **The staging budget is enforced on actual usage, not on a predicted decompression
  ratio and not on any declared size.** Measured expansion of a download into staged files
  spans ~1x (already-compressed payloads) to 4.1x (a 3.86 GB zip → 15.9 GB of vasprun.xml),
  and 880x for a synthetic archive. So each ~1 MB chunk is charged *before* it is written and
  refunded on delete (`fetch.StagingBudget`), giving `staged <= limit` for any archive, any
  expansion ratio and any single-file size. Archive headers / manifest sizes / `Content-Length`
  are used only as a cheap "don't even start" pre-check (`StagingBudget.check`) — never as
  the accounting, because the production run is uncapped (`--max-bytes 0`) and would
  otherwise be bounded by whatever the metadata claimed. `.7z` decompresses in one library
  call, so its charge lives in a `py7zr` `WriterFactory` (`_BudgetedWriterFactory`); the
  refusal is recorded rather than raised, because an exception inside py7zr's own threads
  would be lost.
  Breach → roll the record back whole → stop resumably → `parse` + `purge-raw` reclaim →
  re-fetch the same batch. That loop is what lets a ~2 TB harvest run inside a fixed quota;
  `purge-raw` also frees the parsed units of a *partially* parsed record, so one unparsable
  unit cannot pin a record's whole tree for the rest of the run.
- **Three properties keep that loop from spinning** (each one was an observed stall):
  (a) a refusal is classified by the record's *own* footprint — including its transient
  archive-plus-extracted peak — so "too big for the budget at all" is a deterministic verdict
  under `--workers N`, not a guess from whether the budget happened to be empty;
  (b) whatever an *unrecorded* record left staged is deleted and refunded immediately, since
  `purge-raw` only reclaims trees that reached the dataset and a leftover would hold budget
  for the rest of the harvest; (c) a parallel pass that stages nothing falls back to a serial
  pass, so concurrent records that each fit but collectively do not cannot deadlock the loop.
  A space refusal never produces a *terminal* rejection reason, so no record is lost to
