## Project overview

`zenodo_harvest` is a computational chemistry/materials science project (summer research project) to build
a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) using openly accessible DFT data. The pipeline has three stages:

1. **Harvest** — programmatically pull DFT calculation data (energy, structure, forces, etc.) from open
   databases via REST APIs. Primary targets: Zenodo (https://developers.zenodo.org/#rest-api) and
   Materials Project (`mp-api` package, https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api). NOMAD and the
   Materials Cloud Archive are now harvested too, by their own source adapters (see below).
2. **Parse & store** — extract structured data from raw DFT output files and store it in a compact,
   interoperable format.
3. **Train** — train an MLIP (e.g. MACE architecture) on the assembled dataset, then use it for
   ML-accelerated MD.

This document describes the intended architecture and domain conventions agreed with the project
mentor. All five stages (discover → triage → fetch → parse → store) now exist as the
`zenodo_harvest` package and run end-to-end. See `docs/DESIGN.md` for the full data/storage design.
**All three VASP harvests are complete (Zenodo, NOMAD, Materials Cloud); the next-phase work plan
(blind-spot discovery → combined curated corpus → MLIP value study) is `docs/FURTHER_WORK.md`.**
**Part A (blind-spot discovery) is BUILT as `zenodo_census/` — a census of every archive-bearing
Zenodo record scored offline + selectively peeked, feeding the ordinary pipeline
(`docs/ZENODO_CENSUS.md`, `scripts/csd3/census/`). Census COMPLETE + scored on CSD3 (583,930 records;
T1 2,933 / T2 33,175) and T1 TRIAGED, then RE-TRIAGED with the deep peeks
(`zenodo_census/deeppeek.py`): 272 VASP-evidence records incl. all 4 known keyword misses, 434 kept
fail-safe → keep-list 680 records / 3.09 TB. T1 HARVEST DONE 2026-10-01 (pipeline + targeted
recovery `scripts/csd3/census/40_recover_t1.sh`): +230 records / +173,289 calcs / +5.67M frames →
Zenodo dataset ~533 records / 355,400 calcs / 17,757,938 frames, verify OK. T2 TRIAGED 2026-10-01:
103 VASP-evidence records of 33,175 (0.31%), 6,217 unresolved (25.7 TB) left unharvested by decision;
T2 HARVEST DONE 2026-10-02 (pipeline 37089987 + recovery 37127828, verify OK): +87 records / +28,449
calcs / +455,181 frames. PART A COMPLETE: the census added +317 records / +201,738 calcs / +6,124,397
frames → Zenodo dataset ~620 records / 383,849 calcs / 18,213,119 frames. Next: part B (combined
corpus). Seed snowball DONE 2026-10-02 (`docs/ZENODO_CENSUS.md` §6 decisions 14-16, §11): re-score
with all ~620 seeds → `zenodo_census.cli select-moved` → triage of the 541 risen records → pipeline
37197208: +9 records / +2,576 calcs / +30,571 frames → Zenodo dataset 629 records / 386,425 calcs /
18,243,690 frames, verify OK, no recovery needed.**

## Code layout & commands

- `zenodo_harvest/` — importable package, runnable without install from the repo root:
  - `client.py` — throttled, retrying Zenodo REST client. Key facts baked in: `q` searches
    metadata only (not file contents), page size caps at 25, the search window caps at 10k
    (bypassed by recursive `created`-date bisection in `iter_records`), file downloads honour
    HTTP Range despite no `Accept-Ranges` header, and **the `/api/records` search endpoint is
    30 req/min even with a token** (token helps other endpoints/quotas + restricted access).
  - `config.py` — `.env` loader (no dependency) + data-dir layout (`data/{manifests,raw,dataset}`),
    overridable via `ZENODO_HARVEST_DATA` (point at cluster scratch).
  - `models.py` — `Candidate` dataclass (JSONL-serialisable) + `classify_files` VASP file-signal
    classifier (`vasp_direct` / `archive` / `processed_atomistic` / `unlikely`).
  - `manifest.py` — JSONL read/append helpers + `RejectionLogger` (auditable dropped-record log).
  - `discover.py` — stage 0: keyword search → deduplicated candidate manifest (dedup by
    `conceptrecid`, newest version wins).
  - `triage.py` — stage 1: filter candidates. `--peek` is **ON by default** — it reads a remote
    `.zip` central directory over HTTP Range (~tens of KB) to confirm `vasprun.xml`/`OUTCAR`
    without downloading the archive, and by default **drops** an archive record when a successful
    peek of every archive proves it holds no VASP (fail-safe: kept if any archive is unpeekable
    tar/rar/7z, too big, or the peek failed). `--no-peek` disables peeking; `--keep-unconfirmed`
    peeks-to-upgrade but never drops. Peeking is ~1000× cheaper than a wasted download.
  - `fetch.py` — stage 2: download (checksum-verified, resumable, `--max-bytes` capped;
    `--max-bytes 0` = no cap) and **selectively extract only VASP files** from archives; the
    archive is deleted right after extraction (persistent disk = extracted files, not archives);
    records availability of heavy files (CHGCAR/WAVECAR/DOSCAR/EIGENVAL/…) without extracting
    them. **Availability is scoped PER CALC**: each heavy file is attributed to the calc whose
    primary sits in the SAME directory (VASP writes CHGCAR/DOSCAR beside the run's vasprun/OUTCAR),
    not OR'd across every calc in the record (the old over-count). `fetched.jsonl` carries a
    `calc_availability` list aligned index-for-index with `calc_units` (parse reads it; a
    record-level `availability` union is kept for older manifests/report tooling).
    **`.zip` uses targeted member fetch by default** (`zipstream.py`; `--no-zip-stream` to
    disable): a ZIP's tail central directory gives every member's byte offset, so the VASP
    files are pulled straight out over HTTP Range (~1 request/file, CRC-verified) **without
    downloading the whole archive** — so a huge zip whose bulk is CHGCAR/WAVECAR (incl. a
    >4 GB ZIP64 heavy file beside 32-bit VASP outputs) transfers only its vasprun/OUTCAR and
    never stages the archive at all (transfer, transient disk, and time all drop; validated
    on Zenodo — the third survey investigation's recommendation #2). It is chosen over a
    whole download only when worthwhile (heavy bytes to skip, or a huge archive) and the
    target count is within `--zip-stream-max-files` (default 128; each member ≈ 1–2 HTTP
    requests, so a many-small-member VASP dump is cheaper whole); anything not addressable
    (ZIP64/encrypted/odd-compression *target* member, enumeration failure, Range ignored, a
    corrupt member) **falls back to the whole-archive download** — never a regression.
    Targeted fetch is deliberately NOT bounded by `--max-bytes`/`--max-member-bytes` (every
    targeted member is a wanted VASP file); only the disk valve bounds it. Enumeration alone
    can prove a zip holds no VASP and skip the download entirely. tar/rar/7z/zst have no tail
    index (or are non-seekable when compressed) and keep the whole-download path.
    **Nested archives** (an archive inside an archive — a `.zip` of per-run `.tar.gz`s, a
    `.tar` of `.zip`s, …) are unpacked recursively *after download* for every archive type
    (`_recurse_nested_archives`, depth cap 8): the extractors also pull out nested-archive
    members and each sub-archive is extracted then deleted+refunded, so VASP files inside
    sub-archives are reached (CHGCAR inside a sub-archive is still recorded as availability
    only). Targeted ZIP fetch **falls back to a whole download** when the zip contains a
    nested archive (the central-directory peek can't see inside it), letting the recursion
    unpack it — random access *into* a compressed sub-archive is impossible (its index sits
    in a non-seekable DEFLATE blob).
    **A bad zip member no longer costs the archive** (2026-10-01): `_extract_zip` skips a member
    whose bytes are unreadable (bad local header, CRC, corrupt deflate) and keeps the rest — one
    `extract_partial` rejection per archive (`PartialExtract`; nothing readable = the old whole-
    archive `extract_error`) — and `_open_zip_member` retries a member at its offset ±k·4 GiB, which
    reads >4 GiB zips written WITHOUT ZIP64 (offsets truncated to 32 bits: zipfile shifts every
    member by the 4 GiB gap); a shifted offset is used only if zipfile finds the signature AND the
    exact name there, and the CRC-32 is checked on read.
    `.rar`/`.7z`/`.tar.zst` extract when the `archives` extra (py7zr/rarfile/zstandard + an
    `unrar`/`bsdtar` binary for rar) is installed, else a logged rejection. Emits
    `fetched.jsonl` (one calc-unit list per record). Three independent size/pacing levers:
    `--max-bytes` (per downloaded file), `--max-member-bytes` (per *extracted* file —
    decompression-bomb guard), and `--max-disk-bytes`/`--max-disk-files` (**staging-budget
    valve**: stop cleanly and resumably once the staging tree reaches a budget — the
    mechanism that lets an *uncapped* multi-TB harvest run inside a fixed quota).
    The valve (`StagingBudget`) charges **every ~1 MB chunk before it is written and every
    inode as it is created**, refunding on delete — never a declared size (archive header,
    manifest `size`, `Content-Length`), since with `--max-bytes 0` the budget is the only
    bound on what reaches disk. Inodes count **directories too** (CSD3 `/rds` is Lustre, so
    its 1M-file quota is an inode quota). `.7z` extracts in one py7zr call, so its charging
    lives in a `WriterFactory` and the refusal is recorded, not raised, because an exception
    inside py7zr's threads would be lost. On a breach: roll the record back whole → stop
    resumably → the pacing loop reclaims → re-fetch. A refusal is classified by the
    **record's own footprint** (so "too big for the whole budget" is deterministic under
    `--workers N`), a space refusal never yields a *terminal* reason (no record is lost to
    pacing), leftovers of an unrecorded record are deleted+refunded at once (`purge-raw`
    could never reclaim them), and a parallel pass that stages nothing retries serially so
    the loop cannot deadlock. `--workers N` downloads N records concurrently (records are
    independent; each stages into its own `raw_dir/<recid>/`, one shared tally, thread-safe).
    Interrupted transfers **resume over HTTP Range** (a cluster job's wallclock
    can expire mid-pull of a >100 GB archive; resume only happens when Zenodo supplied a
    checksum, so stale bytes are always caught). Stats report `peak_staged_bytes`/
    `peak_staged_files`, so "did we stay inside the limits?" is answerable from the summary.
  - `pipeline.py` — stages 2–4 **overlapped**: `run_pipeline` fetches batch *i+1* in the
    foreground while `parse`+`purge-raw` for batch *i* runs in the background, so the
    network is not idle during parsing (parses serialise on the dataset dir's lock). It is
    I/O-agnostic (plain callables) so it unit-tests without the network or pymatgen. A
    `fetch_fn` returning `False` means "batch only partly fetched" (the disk valve tripped):
    the orchestrator drains the background parse+purge to reclaim staging and **resumes the
    same batch** — a partly-fetched batch is never carried on and silently dropped. If it
    still cannot complete with nothing left to drain, the run stops with a reported error
    rather than under-fetching every later batch.
  - `parse.py` — stage 3: pymatgen `Vasprun` (primary) → per-ionic-step ASE frames; tags each
    frame with *its own* step's electronic convergence bool + magnitude (`scf_dE`), drops steps
    with no recoverable energy, records `run_type`, full INCAR/k-points/POTCAR, availability
    flags. **`scf_dE`/`electronic_converged` are now filled on ALL parser paths** (`convergence.py`):
    the vasprun path uses pymatgen's per-electronic-step σ→0 energies (`_step_scf`); the OUTCAR
    path scans the OUTCAR SCF trace (`Iteration X(Y)` + `total energy-change (2. order)` lines →
    free-energy `scf_dE`, `n_esteps<NELM` verdict — `scf_dE_key="free_energy"`); a `vaspout` calc
    (whose HDF5 carries no per-SCF data) is filled from a co-located OUTCAR, else stays null. Every frame also carries the calc's **net magnetic moment** `total_magnetization` +
    **net charge** `total_charge` (broadcast; `electronic.py`), mirrored into a metadata
    `electronic` block. `parse_vasprun` enables `parse_eigen` (for the occupancy method) ONLY
    for a collinear spin-polarised vasprun **without** an OUTCAR — a cheap streaming ISPIN
    pre-scan (`_scan_vasprun_spin_flags`) gates it, so the ISPIN=1 majority and every
    OUTCAR-accompanied calc parse unchanged. **Per-atom** `dft_charge`/`dft_magmom` are NO LONGER
    stored (removed for cross-parser consistency — OUTCAR-only never had them); only the totals. Availability is taken PER CALC from fetch's `calc_availability` (falling back to the
    record-level union for pre-fix manifests) and **refined by a cheap embedded probe of the
    primary**: DOS/eigenvalues/projected written straight into a vasprun.xml (a streaming
    `<dos`/`<eigenvalues`/`<projected` tag scan, never parsing the arrays) or vaspout.h5 (its
    `/results` group names) are OR'd on, so a calc with no standalone DOSCAR/EIGENVAL/PROCAR file
    is no longer under-counted. OUTCAR-only calcs fall back to ASE's `vasp-out` reader (read from an isolated temp
    copy — ASE otherwise crashes on uploads with hash-annotated POTCAR species). Manifest paths
    resolve against `--raw-dir`. `--max-primary-bytes` (0 = off) refuses to *attempt* a
    primary output above a size and logs a `primary_too_large` rejection instead — pymatgen
    holds a whole ionic trajectory in memory, so under a batch scheduler one huge
    `vasprun.xml` is not a catchable `MemoryError` but a cgroup SIGKILL of the entire job
    (taking the fetch progress with it). If a smaller sibling primary exists in the same
    unit (a huge `vasprun.xml` beside a modest `OUTCAR`) it is used instead of dropping the calc.
    **`--parse-timeout`** (seconds; CLI default 1200 = 20 min, 0 = off) parses each calc unit
    in a **forkserver child process hard-killed on timeout**, so one *non-terminating*
    pymatgen/ASE parse (e.g. a truncated `vasprun.xml` whose OUTCAR fallback loops for hours)
    is logged `parse_timeout` and skipped rather than silently **freezing the whole overlapped
    pipeline** until wallclock — a Python-level timeout can't help (the hang is in a C
    extension that ignores signals, and a stuck thread can't be killed). It also isolates a
    parse OOM into the child instead of a cgroup-kill of the job. A `parse_timeout` is
    non-terminal (absent from metadata), so a later/longer run re-attempts it, like
    `primary_too_large`. Each calc is logged (`INFO parsing <calc_id>`) *before* it starts, so
    a slow/hung parse is identifiable live via `tail -f` and by the last log line on a kill.
    On resume, calcs already rejected with a **deterministic** parse failure
    (`vasprun`/`vaspout`/`outcar_parse_error`, `no_frames`) are **skipped** rather than
    re-parsed (`_rejected_calc_ids`) — re-running the parser on a proven-unparseable file
    wastes minutes per resume on a big bad record and duplicated rejection lines;
    `--retry-rejected` re-attempts them (use after a pymatgen/ase upgrade). `parse_timeout`/
    `primary_too_large`/`parse_worker_died` stay retryable (absent from the skip set).
    **OUTCAR-only calcs now recover the FULL calc parameters from the OUTCAR header** (not
    just the trajectory): `_parse_outcar_ase` reads the header via `outcar_params` so
    `run_type`/`functional`/INCAR/effective `parameters`/k-points/POTCAR are populated to
    parity with the vasprun path (closing the 25.6%-null-functional gap). The vasprun path
    also stores VASP's resolved `parameters` block now (the metadata-gaps "better fix").
    **`--parse-workers N`** (default 1 = serial) parses N calc units CONCURRENTLY — N worker
    threads each run the timeout-guarded `_parse_one` (child forks serialise in the forkserver but
    the parses run in parallel) while the MAIN thread writes each result's frames-then-metadata
    serially (single writer → the one-calc-at-a-time crash-safety/prune invariant is preserved;
    results land in completion order, which is fine — frame_ids are unique). This is the lever for
    a **parse-throughput-bound** harvest of MANY SMALL calcs: NOMAD's ~7M tiny vaspruns parse
    ~0.26 s each single-threaded (~21 days) → N-way cuts that ~N-fold until the serial fetch
    (~4 MB/s single connection) becomes the bound. Use with `--parse-timeout>0` (real child
    processes); keep `parse_workers × per-parse RSS` under the node RAM (NOMAD vaspruns are tiny).
    **Numeric `ALGO` is tolerated** (`_guard_numeric_algo`, 2026-10-01): pymatgen's
    `converged_electronic` (run inside `Vasprun.__init__`) did `incar["ALGO"].lower()` and crashed on
    a legacy numeric `ALGO = 48`, rejecting valid vaspruns; the guard (same recipe as the one-off NOMAD
    `recover_int_algo.py`, now at every parse entry point so it holds in forkserver children) coerces
    it to its string form — output identical to the same file with a string ALGO.
    Two more tolerances (2026-10-02, census T2), same contract — a file that parsed before is read
    exactly as before: an OUTCAR with a few **non-UTF-8 bytes** (VASP prints an uninitialised buffer in
    "vdW correction parametrized for the method …" with TS/MBD + hybrids; ASE reads strictly) is
    re-read from its temp copy with those bytes replaced (`outcar_invalid_utf8_lines` recorded; a
    replaced byte inside a number still fails the parse), and `_guard_overflowed_params` reads an
    all-asterisk scalar in `<parameters>`/`<incar>` (VASPsol's `LAMBDA_D_K=****`) as `None`, as
    pymatgen already does for `RANDOM_SEED` — before, such a vasprun survived only via an OUTCAR beside it.
    **`parse_eigen` is best-effort** (`_open_vasp_besteffort`): enabling it for the occupancy net
    moment must never drop a calc, so a vasprun whose `<eigenvalues>` pymatgen cannot read
    (`KeyError('eigenvalues')` on some real ISPIN=2 uploads) is retried WITHOUT eigenvalues — the
    calc + net charge are kept, only the net moment falls back to `None`.
    **Nothing escapes the audit trail** (2026-09-25): `_frame` rejects a force array whose shape
    is not `(n_atoms, 3)` (it is set straight into `atoms.arrays`, bypassing ASE's check — a
    1-row array would otherwise be silently broadcast onto every atom by the extxyz writer), and
    any exception that still escapes a calc's parse or frame write is recorded as a non-terminal
    `parse_error` rejection against that calc in BOTH loops (it used to be a calc_id-less log line
    in the parallel loop); a storage `OSError` (disk full) stops the parse instead.
  - `outcar_params.py` — parse an OUTCAR **header** into a vasprun-schema `calc_parameters`:
    the user `INCAR:` echo (via pymatgen's canonical `Incar` parser, stdlib fallback) + the
    resolved-parameter blocks (`parameters`) + POTCAR titels + k-points. `run_type` is
    classified **faithfully to pymatgen 2026.5.4's `Vasprun.run_type`** (same GGA/METAGGA
    tables + hybrid/+U/+vdW rules), validated by a live same-calc cross-check (mine(OUTCAR) ==
    pymatgen(vasprun), incl. HSE06/GGA+U). Reads `IVDW`/`METAGGA` from the user INCAR (never
    the resolved default `IVDW=0`, which would add a spurious `+vdW-no-correction`). Pure
    stdlib except the optional pymatgen `Incar`; unit-tested offline.
  - `param_resolver.py` — pure-logic resolver filling effective VASP params from stored
    metadata: user INCAR > resolved `parameters` (authoritative, `source="parameters"`) > VASP
    documented defaults / run_type-derived hybrid mixing; genuinely-unknown values stay None.
    Exposed as `enrich-metadata` (writes `calc_parameters.resolved`; ADDS a field only, so the
    frame_id bijection holds). Backward compatible: records with no `parameters` block behave
    exactly as before.
  - `outcar_recover.py` — targeted recovery of the OUTCAR metadata gap **without rebuilding
    shards** (the physical data is already correct; only calc-level `calc_parameters` was
    impoverished). `build_outcar_keeplist` emits a slim keep-list of just the ~230 records
    holding an OUTCAR calc; re-fetch them with the ordinary `fetch` (targeted-zip pulls only
    the OUTCAR out of a `.zip`); `refresh_outcar_metadata` re-parses each OUTCAR header and
    overwrites ONLY those records' `calc_parameters` in metadata.jsonl —
    `calc_id`/`frame_ids`/`shards` left byte-identical (verify still passes, no shard opened),
    atomic rewrite under `.parse.lock` + one-time `metadata.jsonl.bak.pre_outcar_refresh`,
    idempotent, `--only-missing` for incremental resume. `reclassify_outcar_run_types`
    (CLI `reclassify-outcar`) re-derives `run_type`/`functional` for every header-parsed OUTCAR
    calc **from its already-stored `incar`/`parameters`** — metadata-only, NO re-fetch and NO
    shard access — so a `classify_run_type` bugfix that lands *after* the 955-GiB recovery ran
    can be applied cheaply (atomic under `.parse.lock` + `metadata.jsonl.bak.pre_reclassify`;
    e.g. it fixed the 57 calcs a boolean-`METAGGA` had mislabeled run_type `"TRUE"` → `GGA`).
  - `vasprun_params.py` + `vasprun_recover.py` — the vasprun analog of the OUTCAR recovery,
    for the missing resolved **`parameters`** block on the ~83k `pymatgen.Vasprun` calcs (they
    were parsed before `_calc_parameters` stored it, so only the user `incar` is present →
    `ISIF`/`ADDGRID`/etc. rely on the resolver's guess). `vasprun_params.parse_vasprun_parameters`
    reads **only the `<parameters>` element** of a vasprun.xml (iterparse, stops before the
    `<calculation>` trajectory → cheap regardless of file size) via pymatgen's own
    `_parse_params`, then `resolved_parameters` renames vasprun's **`ENMAX`→`ENCUT`** (the
    `<parameters>` block has no `ENCUT`) and restricts to `EFFECTIVE_TAGS` — the SAME function
    `parse._calc_parameters` now uses, so a live parse and a recovered record emit a
    byte-identical block. `build_vasprun_keeplist` + `refresh_vasprun_metadata` (CLI
    `vasprun-keeplist`/`refresh-vasprun`) re-fetch the vasprun records and write ONLY the
    `parameters` block into their `calc_parameters` (dropping the stale `resolved`;
    `run_type`/`functional`/`incar`/`calc_id`/`frame_ids`/`shards` untouched → verify passes),
    atomic under `.parse.lock` + `metadata.jsonl.bak.pre_vasprun_refresh`, `--only-missing` for
    resume. CSD3 campaign: `scripts/csd3/45_vasprun_recover.sh` (mirrors 44). Run
    `enrich-metadata` after to regenerate `resolved` from the authoritative parameters.
  - `availability_recover.py` — the **per-calc `availability`** analog of the OUTCAR/vasprun
    recovery, for the dataset built before availability was scoped per-calc + probed. Applies the
    corrected flags to the already-built dataset **without rebuilding shards**:
    `build_availability_keeplist` selects EVERY record holding a dataset calc (availability is
    universal, not a parser subset); re-fetch with the ordinary `fetch` (targeted-zip pulls the
    vasprun + central-directory listing out of a `.zip`); `refresh_availability_metadata` recomputes
    each calc's availability = per-calc filename flags (from the re-fetch's `calc_availability`) ∪
    the embedded vasprun/vaspout probe (`parse._merge_embedded_availability`) + spin_density/
    magnetization re-derived from the record's own `spin_polarized`/`site_magmoms_present`
    (`outcar_recover._recompute_spin_availability`), and overwrites ONLY that record's
    `availability` (`calc_id`/`frame_ids`/`shards`/`calc_parameters` byte-identical → verify passes).
    CLI `availability-keeplist`/`refresh-availability`; atomic under `.parse.lock` +
    `metadata.jsonl.bak.pre_availability_refresh`. **Resume-safe with NO metadata marker**: the
    refresh only touches calcs whose primary is STILL STAGED, so a purged (already-done) batch is
    skipped — presence of the source file IS the resume state. CSD3 campaign:
    `scripts/csd3/46_availability_recover.sh` (mirrors 45; batched fetch→refresh→purge, dedicated
    `raw_availability` dir, explicit pre-job metadata backup, verify-only finalize — no enrich).
  - `convergence.py` — per-ionic-step **electronic (SCF) convergence from an OUTCAR body**, so an
    OUTCAR-parsed calc (and a `vaspout` calc with a co-located OUTCAR) reaches vasprun-level per-frame
    tagging. `scan_outcar_scf` streams the `Iteration X(Y)` markers + `total energy-change (2. order)`
    lines: the last such value in ionic step X is `|ΔF|` = that step's `scf_dE` (free-energy basis —
    the OUTCAR prints σ→0 only per ionic step, not per SCF step, so `scf_dE_key="free_energy"` vs the
    vasprun path's `"e_0_energy"`; the two differ only by the near-converged inter-step entropy change,
    and ΔF is VASP's own EDIFF metric). `outcar_scf_convergence` adds the `n_esteps<NELM` verdict
    (`outcar_nelm` reads NELM from the header) — same rule as `parse._step_scf`. vaspout.h5 has NO
    per-SCF data (pymatgen hard-codes `electronic_steps=[]`), so vaspout-**without**-OUTCAR stays null.
    Also `converged_ionic_from_params` — a pymatgen-`Vasprun.converged_ionic`-faithful reimplementation
    (from NSW/IBRION/EDIFFG + the ionic-step count) so the **OUTCAR** path reaches calc-level
    `quality.ionic_converged` parity with the vasprun/vaspout paths (which get it from pymatgen). The
    ionic-convergence *magnitude* (last-two-frames ΔE) is deliberately NOT stored — it is not a
    per-frame label-quality signal for training (off-equilibrium frames are valid data) and is
    derivable from the stored `REF_energy`/`REF_forces`. `cparam` reads a VASP tag from a stored
    `calc_parameters` dict (shared by the OUTCAR parse + recovery). Pure stdlib (reuses
    `outcar_params._open_text` for gz/bz2/xz); offline-tested.
  - `electronic.py` — per-calc **net magnetic moment** (μ_B, = N_up−N_down = 2·S) + **net charge**
    (e, = Z_neutral−NELECT; + = electron-deficient), the values stored on every frame
    (`total_magnetization`/`total_charge`) and mirrored into the metadata `electronic` block. Net
    moment: `Outcar.total_mag`-style last-`magnetization`-line scan when an OUTCAR is present (norm
    for non-collinear); else doped's eigenvalue-**occupancy** method (`N_up−N_down`, needs
    `parse_eigen`) for a collinear spin vasprun/vaspout without an OUTCAR; 0 for ISPIN=1; **null**
    for non-collinear without an OUTCAR (needs the heavy projected magnetization). Net charge:
    `NELECT` from parameters + Z_neutral from the vasprun `<atominfo>` valence col (pymatgen
    discards it) / OUTCAR header `POMASS;ZVAL`×`ions per type` / the bundled `potcar-summary-stats`
    titel→ZVAL table (vaspout fallback). Unknowns stay `None` (never a fabricated 0). Also
    `is_magnetic` (spin-polarised OR non-collinear) — the single source of the
    `availability["magnetization"]` flag now that per-atom magmoms are gone. Pure-ish + offline-tested.
  - `net_properties_recover.py` — retrofit net moment/charge **+ OUTCAR SCF convergence** onto an
    **already-built** dataset in ONE shard pass; UNLIKE the other recoveries this **REWRITES SHARDS**
    (the values live on the frames). A shard mixes calcs, so **two phases**: `compute_net_properties`
    (Phase 1, disk-paced) re-fetches every record and computes each calc's net moment/charge
    (`parse.electronic_block_for_unit`) — and, for **`ase.OUTCAR`** calcs, its per-frame
    `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged` (`parse.convergence_block_for_unit`; vasprun calcs already have
    σ→0 `scf_dE` from the live parse) — into a `net_properties.jsonl` map (`{electronic, convergence?}`
    per calc; resumable by map membership, no shard touched); `apply_net_properties` (Phase 2, local,
    ONCE after Phase 1 completes) drives the map in via a **text-level** shard edit — append the two
    totals (+ OUTCAR frames' `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged` for that frame's `ionic_step`) to each
    frame's comment line + strip the `dft_magmom`/`dft_charge` columns, leaving every untouched value
    **byte-identical** (no ASE re-serialise → no float drift) — then an atomic metadata rewrite (add
    `electronic`, drop `site_*_present`, overwrite OUTCAR calcs' `quality` convergence fields, and
    **backfill calc-level `ionic_converged` for OUTCAR calcs** from each record's OWN
    `calc_parameters` + `n_ionic_steps` via `converged_ionic_from_params` — metadata-only, no re-fetch,
    covers every OUTCAR record). Idempotent + resumable (`.net_properties_applied` marker); `verify`
    still passes (frame_ids/shards/calc_id untouched). CLI `net-properties-keeplist`/`compute-net-properties`
    (needs `--dataset-dir` for the parser lookup)/`apply-net-properties`; CSD3 campaign
    `scripts/csd3/47_net_properties_recover.sh` (Phase-1 batched loop, then Phase-2 apply+verify once).
    Structured so a later per-frame field (e.g. an OUTCAR **ionic**-convergence ΔE — distinct from
    this electronic `scf_dE`) is another Phase-1 field + the same Phase-2 edit.
  - `store.py` — stage 4: `ShardedExtxyzWriter` (rotating `shard-NNNNN.extxyz.gz`) +
    `MetadataWriter` (one JSONL record per calc), joined by `calc_id`/`frame_id`.
  - `status.py` — read-only progress snapshot: line-counts the append-only manifests +
    walks the raw/dataset trees to report per-stage counts, fetch/parse **progress %**
    (fetched vs keep-list; parsed calcs vs fetched calc-units), staging **bytes+inodes vs
    quota**, and a **rejection-reason histogram**. No network, no lock — safe to run (or
    `watch`) *while* a fetch/pipeline job is writing the same files. It also reads the fetch
    rejections where `pipeline` writes them (`<raw-dir>/../manifests/rejections.jsonl`), lists EVERY
    rejection reason (a top-8 cut once hid `primary_too_large`), and
    `--scope-to-keep` counts only the keep-list's records (calcs, frames, fetched manifests,
    rejections) — the progress of one run writing into an existing dataset (the census keep-lists).
  - `dataset_ops.py` — array-job glue (stages over dataset dirs, not the network):
    - `split` — split a manifest into `<stem>.part-NNN.jsonl` parts, one per array task.
      `--weight-by records` (default) round-robins (balances record count); `--weight-by
      calcs` LPT-bin-packs by each record's `n_calc_units` so per-task *parse cost* is
      balanced (fixes the array-parse imbalance when records vary a lot in calc-unit count;
      it cannot split one record across parts, and degrades to count-balancing on a
      keep-list, which has no calc counts yet).
    - `merge-datasets` — fold per-task dataset dirs into one (rename+renumber shards, never
      recompressing them; rewrite each metadata record's `shards`; refuse locked/duplicate
      sources; post-verify the merged join).
    - `verify` — assert the metadata↔shard `frame_id` bijection + report curation stats
      (frames by parser/run_type/functional/license, element coverage) — the cheap gate after
      every array job.
    - `purge-raw` — delete `<raw-dir>/<recid>/` trees whose every calc_id is already in the
      dataset (reclaim scratch); `--dry-run` reports without deleting.
  - `cli.py` — `python -m zenodo_harvest.cli {discover,triage,fetch,parse,pipeline,split,merge-datasets,verify,enrich-metadata,outcar-keeplist,refresh-outcar,reclassify-outcar,vasprun-keeplist,refresh-vasprun,availability-keeplist,refresh-availability,net-properties-keeplist,compute-net-properties,apply-net-properties,purge-raw,status} ...`
    (loads `.env`; `verify`/`merge-datasets`/`pipeline` exit non-zero on an integrity failure;
    `status` is read-only and always exits 0, `--json` for machine output).
    Parse and merge take a `.parse.lock` on the dataset dir so two writers never corrupt one
    dir. `pipeline` always runs `verify` and prints a JSON summary — including any
    `fetch_error`/`process_errors` — even when a stage failed hard, so a long unattended run
    never loses its report.
- Manifests are JSONL under `data/manifests/`; the dataset (extxyz.gz shards + `metadata.jsonl`)
  under `data/dataset/` (all gitignored). Full trial run:
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli discover --query VASP --query OUTCAR --max-records 200 \
      --out data/manifests/candidates.jsonl
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli triage --in data/manifests/candidates.jsonl \
      --out data/manifests/keep.jsonl --min-rank 3          # peek is ON by default
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli fetch --in data/manifests/keep.jsonl --max-bytes 500000000
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli parse --in data/manifests/fetched.jsonl
  ```
  Full cluster harvest (batch templates in `scripts/csd3/`): add `--exhaustive` to `discover`,
  then run stages 2–4 as one overlapped, disk-paced command:
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli pipeline --in data/manifests/keep.jsonl \
      --parts 40 --workers 4 --max-bytes 0 --max-member-bytes 30000000000 \
      --max-disk-bytes 800000000000 --max-disk-files 800000 --max-primary-bytes 2000000000
  ```
  `--max-disk-bytes` bounds the **whole** raw staging dir — it already covers both
  concurrently-staged batches, so size it ~0.8 × quota (leaving headroom for in-flight
  archives, which are briefly downloaded *and* extracted, plus the dataset dir on the same
  quota). Discovery is capped server-side at 30 req/min — single-stream by design,
  do NOT parallelise it; only `fetch` benefits from `--workers`.
  **`--max-primary-bytes` is a RAM guard, not a disk lever**: pymatgen's peak RSS is
  ~10 × the vasprun.xml/OUTCAR size (measured on CSD3 icelake-himem: a 534 MB file peaks at
  ~5.6 GB), and an over-budget parse is a cgroup SIGKILL — so run this on `icelake-himem` and
  size the cap to the job's RAM (`~0.85 × cpus-per-task × 6.76 GB ÷ 10`, less room for the
  concurrent fetch; e.g. `--cpus-per-task=4` → ~26 GiB → ~2.0 GB cap). The cap is compared
  against the **uncompressed** size for gzip primaries (`vasprun.xml.gz`/`OUTCAR.gz`, read
  from the gzip ISIZE trailer), since RAM tracks the decompressed trajectory, not the bytes
  on disk. It only skips (logs `primary_too_large`, keeps the staged file) — the calc can
  be re-parsed later on a bigger-RAM job. Calibrate with `scripts/csd3/csd3_parse_memory.py`.
  **Parallel parse under a RAM budget** (2026-09-29): `pipeline`/`parse` take `--parse-workers`,
  `--parse-mem-budget`, `--parse-rss-ratio` (defaults = serial, the old behaviour); each parse
  reserves ~ratio × its uncompressed primary FIFO, so the cap becomes a per-file bound (ratio × cap
  ≤ budget). `scripts/csd3/20_pipeline.sh` sizes them from the job's RAM: 8 icelake-himem cores →
  4 parse workers, 42 GiB budget, 3.8 GB cap (`sbatch -c 12` → 6.1 GB); successors keep the shape.
  Parallel parse on the cluster (array-job model): `split` the fetched manifest into N parts,
  run N array tasks each parsing its part into its OWN `--dataset-dir`, then `merge-datasets`
  the per-task dirs into one, `verify` the merged dataset, and `purge-raw` the parsed archives:
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli split --in data/manifests/fetched.jsonl --parts 16 \
      --out-dir data/manifests/parts
  # array task i: parse --in .../fetched.part-0i.jsonl --dataset-dir data/dataset/task-i ...
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli merge-datasets --into data/dataset data/dataset/task-*
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli verify --dataset-dir data/dataset
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli purge-raw --raw-dir data/raw --dataset-dir data/dataset
  ```
  **OUTCAR metadata recovery** (fill run_type/functional/INCAR for the OUTCAR-parsed calcs,
  metadata-only — shards untouched; CSD3 template `scripts/csd3/44_outcar_recover.sh` runs
  this as a self-resubmitting, disk-paced campaign):
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli outcar-keeplist --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --keep data/manifests/keep.jsonl --out data/manifests/outcar_keep.jsonl
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli fetch --in data/manifests/outcar_keep.jsonl \
      --out data/manifests/outcar_fetched.jsonl --max-bytes 0    # targeted-zip pulls just OUTCARs
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli refresh-outcar --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --fetched data/manifests/outcar_fetched.jsonl              # overwrites calc_parameters only
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli enrich-metadata --dataset-dir data/dataset   # refresh resolved cache
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli verify --dataset-dir data/dataset            # bijection still holds
  ```
  **Availability recovery** (recompute per-calc `availability` for a dataset built before the
  per-calc-scoping + embedded-probe fixes, metadata-only — shards untouched; CSD3 template
  `scripts/csd3/46_availability_recover.sh` runs this as a self-resubmitting, disk-paced,
  batched campaign that also takes an explicit pre-job metadata backup):
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli availability-keeplist --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --keep data/manifests/keep.jsonl --out data/manifests/availability_keep.jsonl  # EVERY record
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli fetch --in data/manifests/availability_keep.jsonl \
      --out data/manifests/availability_fetched.jsonl --raw-dir data/raw_availability --max-bytes 0
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli refresh-availability --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --fetched data/manifests/availability_fetched.jsonl --raw-dir data/raw_availability  # overwrites `availability` only
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli verify --dataset-dir data/dataset            # bijection still holds
  ```
  (no `enrich-metadata` step — availability does not feed the resolver. The refresh must run
  BEFORE `purge-raw` each batch: the embedded DOS/eigen probe reads the STAGED vasprun.)
  **Net moment/charge + OUTCAR-convergence recovery** (add `total_magnetization`/`total_charge` to
  every frame + the metadata `electronic` block, strip per-atom `dft_*`, AND add
  `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged` to every OUTCAR-parsed calc's frames + its `quality`, on a dataset
  built before this — this one **REWRITES SHARDS**; CSD3 template
  `scripts/csd3/47_net_properties_recover.sh` runs the whole two-phase campaign in one shard pass).
  Phase 1 is a batched fetch→compute→purge loop building the map (`compute-net-properties` needs
  `--dataset-dir` to read each calc's parser — only `ase.OUTCAR` calcs get the SCF-trace scan); Phase 2
  applies it ONCE (verify still passes; frame_ids/shards/calc_id untouched):
  ```
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli net-properties-keeplist --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --keep data/manifests/keep.jsonl --out data/manifests/net_properties_keep.jsonl  # EVERY record
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli fetch --in data/manifests/net_properties_keep.jsonl \
      --out data/manifests/net_properties_fetched.jsonl --raw-dir data/raw_net_properties --max-bytes 0
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli compute-net-properties --fetched data/manifests/net_properties_fetched.jsonl \
      --raw-dir data/raw_net_properties --out data/manifests/net_properties.jsonl --dataset-dir data/dataset
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli apply-net-properties --dataset-dir data/dataset \
      --net-properties data/manifests/net_properties.jsonl   # REWRITES SHARDS (adds totals, strips dft_*)
  python -m zenodo_harvest.cli verify --dataset-dir data/dataset            # bijection still holds
  ```
  (`compute-net-properties` re-uses the SAME `electronic.py` + `convergence.py` code a fresh parse
  uses — validated live: a recovered OUTCAR `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged` is byte-identical to a
  freshly-parsed one. `apply` is idempotent + resumable via a `.net_properties_applied` marker; run
  Phase 2 only after Phase 1 is complete — a shard mixes calcs, so a partial map would leave some
  frames unset.)
- `ZENODO_TOKEN` lives in `.env` (gitignored, loaded by `config.load_dotenv`). Stage 0–1 depend
  only on `requests`; stages 2–4 need `pymatgen` + `ase` (`pip install -e .[parse]`).
- **Frame properties**: per-ionic-step energy (`e_0_energy`, σ→0, with pymatgen's `final_energy`
  bugfix applied to *every* step) and forces are written to extxyz under MACE's default
  **`REF_energy`/`REF_forces`** keys — placed directly in `atoms.info`/`atoms.arrays` (not via a
  `SinglePointCalculator`, whose reserved `energy`/`forces` keys ASE re-absorbs into a calculator on
  read-back, removing them from `info`/`arrays`). A step with no recoverable energy (e.g.
  GW/response) is **dropped** (energy-only steps, no forces, are kept); kept frames keep their
  original ionic-step index in `frame_id`/`ionic_step`. Each frame's `electronic_converged`/`scf_dE`
  are **that step's own** SCF verdict/magnitude on **every parser path** (`convergence.py`): the
  vasprun path from pymatgen's per-electronic-step σ→0 energies, the OUTCAR path from the OUTCAR SCF
  trace (free-energy `scf_dE`, `scf_dE_key="free_energy"`), a `vaspout` calc from a co-located OUTCAR
  (null without one — the HDF5 has no SCF trace). Calc-level `quality` keeps the final-step verdict
  plus counts: `n_frames`, `n_frames_scf_unconverged`, `n_frames_with_forces`,
  `n_frames_dropped_no_energy`. **Stress is a training label** (mentor 2026-07-20): per-frame
  stress is written under MACE's **`REF_stress`** key in **ASE's convention** — a Voigt-6 vector
  `[xx,yy,zz,yz,xz,xy]` in eV/Å³ with ASE's sign. The vasprun/vaspout path converts VASP's raw
  kBar tensor (`× −0.1 × ase.units.GPa` + Voigt reorder, exactly ASE's own vasprun.xml reader);
  the OUTCAR path uses ASE's already-converted `vasp-out` stress. **Net magnetic moment +
  net charge** (`electronic.py`): every frame carries the calc's `total_magnetization` (μ_B,
  = N_up−N_down = 2·S) and `total_charge` (e, = Z_neutral−NELECT), broadcast (net charge is
  frame-invariant; net moment is the calc's converged value) and mirrored into the metadata
  `electronic` block. Net moment ← OUTCAR magnetization line when present, else the eigenvalue-
  occupancy method (doped's `N_up−N_down`) for a collinear spin vasprun/vaspout without an
  OUTCAR (0 for ISPIN=1; null for non-collinear-without-OUTCAR). **Per-atom** DFT charges/spins
  are NOT stored (only the totals) — removed for cross-parser consistency (OUTCAR-only never
  had them); retrofit the existing dataset with `net_properties_recover.py` (CSD3 script 47).
- **Energy-reference tracking** (2026-07-20): the label is E0 (σ→0) but VASP's forces/stress are
  consistent with the *free* energy F, so every frame stores F as `E_free` (vasprun also the exact
  entropy term `entropy_TS` = E−F); `quality.max_abs_free_minus_e0_per_atom` lets a train-time
  filter drop frames where |F−E0| makes E0 an unreliable label for the stored forces.
  `calc_parameters.potcar_set_hash` (a hash of the ordered POTCAR TITEL strings; works on both
  parser paths) fingerprints the pseudopotential set — a real cross-record consistency key, since
  absolute VASP energies are only comparable within an identical POTCAR set + functional + settings.

## Other source adapters

Each extra data source is a separate package that reuses the shared `zenodo_harvest` stages and
writes the same schema into its OWN data tree (calc_ids namespaced by `provenance.source`); each
has its own `CLAUDE.md` with the details:

- `nomad_harvest/` — NOMAD direct-upload VASP (7.07M calcs; `docs/NOMAD_HARVEST.md`). **Caveat
  (found 2026-10-03, `docs/DATASET_EVALUATION.md`)**: 6.20M of those calcs / 42.4M of 52.5M frames
  are the Alexandria database's own runs (paths carry Alexandria ids `agm…`, uploaded 2024 by its
  authors) plus the same group's 2017 perovskite set, i.e. institutional data already in
  Alexandria / sAlex / OMat24. NOMAD's individual uploads are ~870k calcs / 10.1M frames;
  `dataset_stats.meta.origin_of` separates them.
- `materials_cloud_harvest/` — Materials Cloud Archive: full census of all ~1.2k records, zip +
  AiiDA-archive peeks (sqlite_zip ones through their `db.sqlite3`), archives no peek can settle
  fetched too, the shared fetch with an anonymous session (`docs/MATERIALS_CLOUD_HARVEST.md`).
  **Harvest COMPLETE 2026-09-25**: 102 records / 75,751 calcs / 2,545,669 frames, verify exact,
  every rejection evaluated (none worth a recovery job) — `docs/MATERIALS_CLOUD_HARVEST_RESULT.md`.
  It added backward-compatible pieces to the shared code: fetch hooks (source-supplied
  `provenance` passthrough, per-file `archive_kind`, `session_factory`; the Zenodo token is now
  attached only to `zenodo.org` hosts), an **AiiDA extractor** (`zenodo_harvest/aiida_archive.py` +
  `fetch._extract_aiida`, `archive_kind="aiida"`: legacy zip/tar + sqlite_zip; nested `.aiida` in
  any archive is recursed), a **parse RAM budget** (`parse(parse_mem_budget=…)`: FIFO per-parse
  reservations of ~12× the primary, so N workers and a large `--max-primary-bytes` coexist), and a
  record-join to `status.py`. Two shared recall fixes (2026-09-24): `zipstream`/Zenodo `triage`
  walk a zip's central directory by its bytes, not the EOCD count (a 16-bit-truncated count made
  targeted fetch able to "prove" an archive VASP-free).

Not a source but a Zenodo discovery front-end, with its own `CLAUDE.md`:

- `zenodo_census/` — FURTHER_WORK part A: replaces keyword discovery with a **census** of every
  record holding an archive or a loose VASP primary (583k records, ~3.4 h at page size 100 with the
  token), offline signals (robust local text matching — Zenodo's `q` loses words glued by `&nbsp;`
  and never stems quoted phrases —, depositor account / ORCID / community of the known-VASP records,
  linked or citing papers that cite the VASP method papers via OpenAlex, Europe PMC data-availability
  mentions) → tiers → ZIP64-aware zip peeks + tar head-peeks under one Zenodo-rate pacer, then deep
  peeks of what they leave unresolved (uncompressed tars walked header to header, 7z end headers,
  archives nested in zips — `deeppeek.py`) → an ORDINARY Zenodo keep-list for `20_pipeline.sh`
  (`docs/ZENODO_CENSUS.md`). Shared changes (backward-
  compatible): `materials_cloud_harvest/remote_zip.py` takes an optional `size=` (Zenodo breaks
  suffix ranges longer than the file), retries a 416 from a stale size, and reports a mid-read
  failure as a failed peek; `zenodo_harvest/models.is_reusable_license` treats `other-closed` as not
  reusable; `zenodo_harvest/client.ZenodoClient._get` takes optional per-request `headers` (the
  census's fallback to InvenioRDM's native serializer for records Zenodo's default JSON serializer
  answers with HTTP 500 — measured on `20797668`).

Not a source but the evaluation of all three, with its own `CLAUDE.md`:

- `dataset_stats/` — read-only statistics of the three datasets and, with the same code, of the
  reference MLIP sets (MPtrj, OMat24 val, sAlex val, MP / Alexandria materials): a parallel
  byte-range `metadata.jsonl` pass (settings, calc types, XC buckets, MP/OMat24 compatibility,
  quality, availability, provenance, Alexandria-origin flag), a resumable per-shard scan (per-frame
  energy / force / stress / hash rows, per-calc composition, vacuum-gap dimensionality, space group),
  and a report with side-by-side and novelty tables (`docs/DATASET_EVALUATION.md`; CSD3 runbook
  `scripts/csd3/stats/`). **Evaluation DONE 2026-10-03** (individual uploads only):
  2,707 deposits / 1.33M calcs / 30.9M frames; 2.67M frames after sAlex's ΔE > 10 meV/atom rule
  (3.8× MPtrj under the same rule); 52% of frames slab / 2D and 12% molecule / cluster, while every
  reference is ≥ 97.7% bulk; 49% of its chemical systems are absent from MP ∪ Alexandria; 96.2% of
  frames pass the default filters.

## Scope and starting point

- Start with **VASP calculations only** (most common DFT code in materials science). Main output files
  to parse: `vasprun.xml` (or `vaspout.h5`) and `OUTCAR`.
- Parse with **pymatgen's `Vasprun` class** in preference to ASE's VASP parsers — mentor's guidance is
  pymatgen is usually more complete/reliable for this. Example notebooks using pymatgen:
  https://matgenb.materialsvirtuallab.org
- A single VASP run may be a geometry relaxation trajectory, not a single-point calculation — pull out
  the structure/energy/forces at *each* ionic step, not just the final one.

## Domain conventions (agreed with mentor — important, non-obvious)

- **Electronic convergence**: always check whether the SCF loop converged before the ionic step finished.
  Pymatgen exposes `Vasprun.converged_electronic` as a bool
  (see https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen-core/blob/v2026.5.18/src/pymatgen/io/vasp/outputs.py#L711),
  but store the actual **magnitude** of non-convergence too: the energy difference between the last and
  second-last electronic step of the final ionic step
  (`vasprun.ionic_steps[-1]["electronic_steps"]` vs. `vasprun.ionic_steps[-2]["electronic_steps"]`).
  Unconverged calculations are noisier and must be tagged, not silently included. This is now tagged
  **per frame** (each ionic step's own SCF verdict/magnitude, mirroring pymatgen's
  `len(electronic_steps) < NELM`), with the calc-level `converged_electronic` (final step) retained
  in `quality`. **The OUTCAR path reaches parity** (`convergence.py`): it scans the OUTCAR's own SCF
  trace (`Iteration X(Y)` + `total energy-change (2. order)` lines) for the same per-frame
  `scf_dE`/`electronic_converged`, with `scf_dE` on a **free-energy basis** (`scf_dE_key="free_energy"`)
  since the OUTCAR prints σ→0 only per ionic step, not per SCF step — a negligible difference at
  convergence, and exactly VASP's own EDIFF metric. A `vaspout` calc (no per-SCF data in the HDF5) is
  filled from a co-located OUTCAR, else `null`.
- **Ionic convergence** (calc-level — did the geometry relaxation finish; distinct from the per-frame
  electronic SCF convergence above): `quality.ionic_converged` is tracked on ALL paths — vasprun/vaspout
  from pymatgen's `converged_ionic`, and the OUTCAR path now at parity via a faithful reimplementation
  (`convergence.converged_ionic_from_params`, from NSW/IBRION/EDIFFG + the ionic-step count). Its
  **magnitude** (the last-two-frames ΔE) is deliberately NOT stored: unlike the electronic `scf_dE` it is
  not a per-frame label-quality signal for MLIP training — off-equilibrium (high-force) frames are valid,
  desirable training data, not noise — and it is anyway derivable from the per-frame
  `REF_energy`/`REF_forces` already stored.
- **Run-type classification**: pymatgen's `Vasprun.run_type` classifies DFT flavour and Hubbard U / vdW
  corrections — useful metadata but too coarse alone to guarantee dataset consistency (foundation-model
  papers, e.g. the NequIP foundation potentials draft, discuss why "one-size-fits-all" settings/datasets
  are problematic).
- **Storage format**: default to **extxyz(.gz)** for the training dataset — easy to read/write with ASE
  and pymatgen, and a de facto standard for MLIP training data. Revisit only if a clearly better option
  is identified.
- **Properties to store** (per structure/frame): positions, chemical symbols, energy, forces, and the
  per-structure **net charge** (`total_charge`) + **net magnetic moment / total spin**
  (`total_magnetization`) — the TOTALS, not per-atom charges/spins (which are not stored; see
  `electronic.py`). Just *record the availability* (not the full data, for storage-size reasons) of:
  charge density, spin density, electronic structure (eigenvalues), magnetization.
- **Provenance is mandatory** for every record: source database, database-specific ID, and any citation
  attached to the data. Also record the full calculation parameter set (k-points, pseudopotentials/POTCARs,
  INCAR-equivalent settings, etc.) — this is as important as the physical data itself for later filtering
  or reproducibility.
- Balance data usefulness against storage cost deliberately — storage on the HPC cluster is expected to
  be a real constraint (discuss with mentor if a dataset needs more space rather than silently dropping data).

## Environment

- Primary development/compute environment is an HPC cluster (CSD3). Long-running harvest jobs and MLIP
  training jobs are expected to run there via the batch scheduler, not interactively.
- **CSD3 constraints the harvest is designed around** (verified against
  [docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk](https://docs.hpc.cam.ac.uk/), 2026-07-27):
  - Wallclock **36 h** (SL1/SL2) / **12 h** (SL3) per job; up to 7 days only via the
    `-long` QoS, which must be requested from support. The harvest can outlast one job,
    so *every* stage is resumable and `scripts/csd3/20_pipeline.sh` can self-resubmit.
  - `/rds/user/<crsid>/hpc-work` (Lustre, **not backed up**) is **1 TB and 1 million
    files** — point `ZENODO_HARVEST_DATA` there, size `--max-disk-bytes` off the 1 TB, and
    pace it with `--max-disk-files` (measured: the inode limit binds before the byte one).
    `/home` is 50 GB (code only).
  - Login nodes are capped at ~4 CPUs per user — fine for a smoke test, not the real fetch.
  - **Compute nodes have outbound internet — VERIFIED 2026-07-31** (`00_check_network.sh`
    PASSed on both `icelake` and `icelake-himem`), so the fetch stage runs in batch as
    designed; no proxy / login-node fallback is needed. (Re-run the probe if the account or
    site network policy changes; if a future node type is ever firewalled, set `https_proxy`
    — honoured by `requests` — or run only `fetch` on a login node.)
- Most work is Python + terminal based. Core libraries: `pymatgen`, `ase`, `mp-api`, and (for training)
  MACE or similar MLIP architectures.
- Toolchain (declared in `pyproject.toml` `[dev]`): **pytest** (tests), **mypy** (types), **ruff** (lint).
  From the repo root:
  ```
  python -m pytest tests/ -q         # offline unit tests (no network / no pymatgen-ase)
  python -m mypy zenodo_harvest/     # type-check (clean)
  ruff check zenodo_harvest/         # lint (install ruff first; not in base env)
  ```
  `tests/test_harvest.py` covers the pure logic (file classifier, the triage/fetch VASP-name
  matchers, the remote zip-peek parser, discover dedup) — fast and network-free; end-to-end runs
  exercise the pymatgen/ase paths.

## Credentials

- API tokens must never be committed. `.gitignore` already excludes `.env`/`.env.*`, `*.key`, `secrets.*`,
  and the pymatgen/mp-api config files `.mprc` and `.pmgrc.yaml`.
- The Materials Project API key is read from the `PMG_MAPI_KEY` environment variable (or `.pmgrc.yaml`) by
  `mp-api`/`pymatgen`. Load secrets from the environment or an untracked `.env`, never hard-coded.
- Large artifacts stay out of git: harvested DFT outputs (`vasprun.xml`, `OUTCAR`, `CHGCAR`, …), the
  `data/`/`datasets/`/`raw/`/`processed/` trees, `*.extxyz(.gz)` datasets, and MLIP checkpoints
  (`*.model`, `*.pt`, `checkpoints/`) are all gitignored — they live on the cluster / external storage.
